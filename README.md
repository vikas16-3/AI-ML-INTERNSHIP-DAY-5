# ðŸ©º Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests - Heart Disease Prediction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to predict heart disease based on clinical features. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Build machine learning models (Decision Tree & Random Forest) to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.
- Evaluate and compare model performance.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset, downloaded using kagglehub.

---

## ðŸ“š Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Kagglehub

---

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. *Import Libraries*  
   Essential libraries for data handling, visualization, and modeling.

2. *Data Acquisition*  
   - Download the dataset from Kaggle using kagglehub.

3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - View dataset info, structure, and distribution.
   - Check for missing values and data types.

4. *Data Preprocessing*  
   - Handle missing values.
   - Feature selection.
   - Encoding categorical variables if needed.
   - Split the data into training and test sets.

5. *Model Building*  
   - Train a Decision Tree classifier.
   - Train a Random Forest classifier.

6. *Model Evaluation*  
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Visual comparison of models

## ðŸ“Š Results

| Model           | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| Decision Tree  | ~98%    |
| Random Forest  | ~99%    |

Random Forest typically outperforms Decision Tree due to its ensemble nature, reducing overfitting.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

- Both models are suitable for classification tasks.
- Random Forest provides better generalization on unseen data.
- This project showcases how traditional machine learning models can effectively handle medicalÂ datasets.
